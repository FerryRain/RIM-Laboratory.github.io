Our research interests include but are not limited to:

🖐️ **Tactile sensors**. We develop tactile sensors for dexterous hands.

🧠 **Learning manipulation skills**. We enable robot to learn object manipulation skills through tactile sensing. 

🌐 **Human-robot interaction**. We explore techniques (e.g., teleoperation) that help robots collaborate with human.
