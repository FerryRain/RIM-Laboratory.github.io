<!-- # The Elli Papaemmanuil Lab -->

Welcome to the Robot Interaction and Manipulation Lab! Our mission is to pioneer the development of robot skills adaptable to both residential and industrial landscapes. Our primary goal is to enhance human lives through robotics, particularly by merging robot tactile sensing and advanced manipulation capabilities. Our research portfolio spans a diverse spectrum, including sensors, motion planning, deep learning, and human-robot interaction.

<!-- We conduct research at three levels. Firstly we perform **systematic genome profiling** of large (>1000) and well-annotated patient cohorts to characterize genetic and clinical inter-relationships. We use advanced statistical modeling to study genotype-phenotype and genotype-outcome relationships as a framework for the development of molecularly guided clinical decision support algorithms to support diagnosis and prognostication of cancer patients. Such population based analysis, enable us to identify genotype combinations that are critical to disease biology, or that associate strongly with clinical presentation, response to treatment and overall survival. -->

<!-- These studies empower our second level research. We use population data to **characterize disease associated, outcome defining and treatment informing genotypes**. We select representative samples for detailed molecular phenotyping using integrative genomic and cell based assays to single cell characterizations. -->

<!-- Last, we perform detailed **clonal heterogeneity tracking studies**. We profile temporally as well as spatially separated samples (diagnosis, pre-treatment, post treatment) to quantify changing clonal phylogenies, during disease progression, or in response to therapeutic intervention. -->
